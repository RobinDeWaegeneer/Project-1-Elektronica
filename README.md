# Project-1-Elektronica

This is the repo contains the code used to instruct the ESP32 Microcontroller for the programmable 5x5x5 Led Cube.

LEDs are a fun and versatile medium, especially when you can control their colors and patterns. While 2D displays already allow for creative visuals, we wanted to add more depth by building a 3D LED cube. Our goal was to create a programmable cube that could sit on a desk or shelf and bring atmosphere through animated light effects.

The project involved designing and building a 5x5x5 LED cube with a total of 125 individually addressable LEDs, controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. The result is a dynamic light show in three dimensions, with custom animations and colors.

Our main focus was to create a working prototype and develop firmware that allows for flexible and updatable lighting patterns. At the same time, this project gave us a valuable opportunity to gain hands-on experience in both project development and management.
